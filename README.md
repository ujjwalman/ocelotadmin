# Ocelot Admin
### Ocelot JSON File Visualisation Console
      
This is a sample JSON file for Ocelot, which is loaded locally within the application. You can learn more about Ocelot by visiting their GitHub repository.
     
The console allows you to visualize the Ocelot JSON, providing a broader understanding. You also have the ability to import your own Ocelot JSON, visualize it, make visual modifications, and then export the updated version. As part of this project, I plan to open source it and integrate the Asp.Net Core library, connecting it with the Administration library.

While this project is a work in progress, it currently covers all the functionalities related to route and global configuration that I am aware of. I am actively working on further developing this project, and once it reaches a presentable state, I will release the source code as open source. Your feedback is highly valuable during this phase. Please feel free to share any suggestions and comments, as they serve as motivation for the project's advancement.
